# USD Test Assets

## Background
As I learn various parts of USD, it's helped me to create simple files to express some area of USD that I'm testing / learning about. This repo is a collection of test files that have been helpful for me.

## How to Understand this Repo

This repo is currently split up into 3 sections, Development (for anything related to software development in USD), Features (some catch-all place for test files I've created overtime for specific use cases), and Schemas. Schemas is currently being built out during the process of writing Schema user docs for openusd.org. I'm finding it helpful and interesting to build out a python script to express all the ideas in the current schema I'm working with to create the associated usda.
